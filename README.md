# A gym tracker app which uses a fully customizable routine creator

## An example project used to practice applying react native code into creating a fully functional app

This project is being actively worked on and will be continuousl updated to implement more features to illustrate my capability and understanding of the react native framework, along with expo, to run a fully functional app. For the time being this is aimed more towards practice for an upcoming presonal project revolving around and targeting enjoyers of anime/manhwa and a more interactive fitness app. The following updates will be applied in the coming future:

* Create custom workout routines with easy ability to editing
* Monitor your previous workouts, including any personal records and previous sets and reps
* Ability to have full support in the personal scheduling of routines, including cardio and other extracurriculars
* In the future this will hopefully blueprint the creation of an app more focused on self improvement than the gym itself
